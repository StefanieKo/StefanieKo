## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a social scientist trained in Python and R with a strong interest in data science and machine learning. I am fascinated by how ML can both deliver accurate predictions and uncover the dynamics of complex systems. I enjoy testing ideas and exploring how data-driven analysis and theoretical intuition can be combined to generate actionable insights. My goal is to apply ML to identify structural leverage points and improve system performance â€” whether in healthcare, climate protection, or administrative processes.
