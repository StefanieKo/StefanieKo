## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a social scientist trained in Python and R with a deep interest in data science and machine learning. I am fascinated not only by how ML methods deliver accurate predictions but also by their potential to uncover insights into structures, interactions, and dynamics within complex systems. What excites me most is exploring the interplay between predictive performance and interpretability and experimenting with ways to combine data-driven analysis with theoretical intuition. I enjoy trying out new approaches, testing ideas, and seeing how different methods can generate actionable insights and reveal concrete levers for intervention. My goal is to apply ML to explore how interventions can support system functioning, uncover structural leverage points, and maintain dynamic equilibria. I aim to help understand and improve complex systems in practice, whether in healthcare, climate protection, or administrative processes.
